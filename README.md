## Description

The Retinal Blood Vessel Segmentation project is a deep learning-based solution for accurately segmenting retinal blood vessels from medical images. This repository contains the code, documentation, and resources related to the project.


## Key Features

- Accurate retinal blood vessel segmentation using the U-Net architecture.
- Extensive training with annotated datasets for superior performance.
- Implementation of various data augmentation techniques.
- Evaluation metrics for assessing segmentation accuracy.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
